This repo is all about how machine learning works. From raw data and model training, what are the cleaning steps and checks which should be carried out, for your model to work on that specific domain.

###### Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence which can learn from provided data to carry out a certain task. The task it learned is particularly for a certain restricted regime, and therefore; and it can not predict anything outside that regime. 


###### Domain specificity is the main limitation of machine learning and deep learning. ML model generally learns a pattern, a function or a mapping in certain regime, and is of no use outside it.

# Data and Data Processing for Machine Learning
We start with the data. Data is an essential part of machine learning. First step is to collect the data for a specific task. You need to collect a sufficiently big and relevant sample for the model to work.
Your sample selection must ensure variance - which means that your data samples should touch each aspect of the regime it is going to be trained in. No variance means no predictability. Once you understand the task you are going to go with, you can decide what sample or features are important for that prediction. There are generally two types of tasks: Supervised Task where you show the model some examples for what it should do given the scenario. And there is another type of task where you just don't have any such ideas. It is called unsupervised learning where all you have is the data.
