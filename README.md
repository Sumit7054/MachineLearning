This repo is all about how machine learning works. From raw data and model training, what are the cleaning steps and checks which should be carried out, for your model to work on that specific domain.

## Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence which can learn from provided data to carry out a certain task. The task it learned is particularly for a certain restricted regime, and therefore; and it can not predict anything outside that regime. 


# Domain specificity is the main limitation of machine learning and deep learning. ML model generally learns a pattern, a function or a mapping in certain regime, and is of no use outside it.
We start with the data. Data is an essential part of machine learning.
